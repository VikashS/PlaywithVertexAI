name: Train Final Model
description: Aggregates predictions and trains a final model.

inputs:
- {name: prediction_inputs, type: List, description: 'List of GCS paths to prediction files'}
outputs:
- {name: final_model_path, type: GCSPath, description: 'GCS path for the final aggregated model'}

    # This command is simplified. Your script would need to handle a list of file paths.
    # KFP passes a JSON-formatted list of strings.
    command: [
      python, -m, fraud.train, # Re-using the train script for simplicity
      --data-path, {inputValue: prediction_inputs}, # Your script must handle this input format
